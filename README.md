# CyberAttackLabs
Throughout my semester taking cyber security, there were various labs that allowed us to make use of what we were learning. By making use of virtual machines, we were able to exploit vulnerabilies in a safe legal way. The labs had me do various attacks, with and without counter measures, I tested and documented throughout each task. Noteable labs were race condition, cross-site request forgery, XSS, SQL Injection, and TCP/IP SYN Flooding attacks. Attached are PDFs to the lab instructions, and my answers to each.
